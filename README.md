# SRE-Security-script
Advanced script involves implementing additional security measures and best practices to further enhance the system's security posture.

This script includes the following additional security measures:

AppArmor: Enables and enforces AppArmor, a mandatory access control framework that restricts programs' capabilities to reduce the potential attack surface.
SELinux: If SELinux is available and desired, this script enables and sets SELinux to enforcing mode for additional mandatory access control.
Auditd: Enables and starts the auditd service for auditing system activities, providing detailed logs for monitoring and analysis.
File Integrity Checking with AIDE: Installs and initializes AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) for file integrity checking, helping to detect unauthorized changes to critical system files.
Log Monitoring with rsyslog: Although not fully configured in the script, rsyslog can be configured to forward logs to a central log server for centralized log management and monitoring.
Before running the script, ensure that you understand the implications of each security measure and customize the script according to your system's requirements.
Test the script in a controlled environment before applying it to production systems.
Additionally, consider other security measures and best practices based on your organization's specific needs and compliance requirements.
